Even if you havenâ€™t studied physics (recently or ever!), you might have heard that E = mc2, wherein 'E' represents energy (measured in Joules), 'm' represents mass (measured in kilograms), and 'c' represents the speed of light (measured approximately as 300000000 meters per second), per Albert Einstein et al. Essentially, the formula means that mass and energy are equivalent.
